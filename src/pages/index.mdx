## FAQ

**Q: How do you pronounce your first name, *Chi*, and your last name, *Zhang*?** \
A: In the English context, *Chi* is usually pronounced /t ÉiÀê/ (like "chi" in "cheese" without the "se"). You can find the Mandarin pronunciation in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTU2n22G6kc) (2nd tone). *Zhang* is often pronounced like "John."

**Q: Why are you based in Pittsburgh instead of SF/SEA/NYC?** \
A: After studying for one and a half years at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, I chose to work remotely from here. The cost of living is lower compared to SF/NYC, and I enjoy the peaceful, slow-paced lifestyle. \
**Update:** I'm planning to move to Mountain View or Seattle in late 2025 or early 2026 as part of the Neon-Databricks acquisition.

**Q: What languages do you speak?** \
A: I speak Mandarin Chinese, English, and Shanghainese, a dialect of Shanghai. I also know some Japanese. ‰Ω†Â•Ω / ‰ªäÊúùÂ§úÂà∞ÊÅ∞ËÄÅÈÖí‰ºê / Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅØÂ∞ë„ÅóÂàÜ„Åã„Çä„Åæ„Åô / Hello!

**Q: What is your favorite programming language?** \
A: Rust. I started learning it in 2018 and have used it ever since.

**Q: When did you start programming?** \
A: I started programming in 2009 during primary school. I spent several years in competitive programming in junior middle and high school. Afterward, I shifted my focus to systems programming and database systems. My first language was BASIC, followed by C. I then learned Ruby (because RPG Maker used it for scripting), and later PHP, JavaScript, C++, Python, Haskell, Rust, and Go.

**Q: When did you start working on databases?** \
A: My database journey began in 2020 when I submitted my first patch to TiKV as part of the LFX Mentorship project (similar to GSoC). Since then, I've focused on databases and storage systems. I consolidated what I have learned throughout the journey and developed a course on building a storage engine from scratch: check out [mini-lsm](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm).

**Q: When will you update your blog (and the courses)?** \
A: I'll try to update them when I have some free time ü´†. In the meantime, you can join the Discord communities for my courses to get quick answers to small questions.

**Q: Can you offer advice for new grads pursuing a career in databases?** \
A: Certainly! Feel free to reach out to me, but please know I might be slow to respond.

**Q: What is the best bubble tea shop in Pittsburgh?** \
A: Tsaocaa has a location near the University of Pittsburgh and another in Squirrel Hill. The newly opened Wushiland is also fantastic. \
**Update:** There are a few new bubble tea spots in Squirrel Hill, and I now recommend Tiger Sugar. Tsaocaa remains on my list, but it's now my second choice.

**Q: Why does [15-445/645](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/) (the CMU database course) seem more challenging since you became a TA in 2022?** \
A: We've been enhancing the projects to make them more engaging and less painful, removing outdated materials, and adding new, industry-relevant content. Except for the Fall 2023 semester, when I proposed too many ambitious ideas, the overall difficulty has stayed consistent.

**Q: Are you planning to go all-in on the AI/LLM hype?** \
A: Not yet, but I'm interested in learning how LLMs work and exploring system optimizations to improve model inference and serving. I've also developed a new course about it called [tiny-llm](https://github.com/skyzh/tiny-llm).
