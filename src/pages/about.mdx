I earned my bachelor’s degree in computer science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University][sjtu] and a master’s degree from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. Currently, I am a Member of Technical Staff at the Lakebase team in Databricks (it's [Neon][neon] acquired by Databricks).

I go by any combination of *Alex*, *Chi*, and *Zhang*. You can call me Alex Chi, Chi Zhang, Alex Chi Z., Chi (Alex) Zhang, or simply Chi.

During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I specialized in building system software, with a particular focus on database systems. I developed [AgateDB][agatedb] during my internship at PingCAP, worked on [TerarkDB][terarkdb] for Zoned Namespace SSDs at ByteDance, and contributed to the early development of [RisingWave][risingwave] at RisingWave Labs (formerly Singularity Data) as a founding member of the company. In the summer of 2023, I interned at [Neon][neon], which offers fully managed Postgres services, and have continued working there as a full-time engineer after graduation.

I’m passionate about engaging with the open-source community. Currently, I’m a maintainer for the [TiKV project][tikv] and also manage several widely used projects such as SJTUG mirror and SJTUThesis in the [SJTUG community][sjtug]. To help more students learn about database systems, I co-developed an educational OLAP database called [RisingLight][risinglight]. The SQL layer of RisingLight was later integrated into [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub), the course project for CMU’s 15-445/645 Database Systems class, transforming BusTub into a functional SQL database system.

I’m also interested in developing educational resources on database systems. I have created two tutorials for using Rust in data-intensive applications: [type-exercise-in-rust](https://github.com/skyzh/type-exercise-in-rust) teaches how to build a vectorized expression evaluation framework within database systems, while [mini-lsm](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm) provides guidance on building an LSM-tree storage engine. I served as a teaching assistant for CMU-DB’s BusTub database system for three semesters, where I designed the SQL query frontend for the [query processing project](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/project3/) and the [MVCC project](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2023/project4/) based on HyPer. With my experience with the BusTub system, I authored the [write-you-a-vector-db](https://github.com/skyzh/write-you-a-vector-db) tutorial on adding vector capabilities to a relational database system. Recently, I developed a course on building an LLM serving infrastructure called [tiny-llm](https://github.com/skyzh/tiny-llm).

Looking ahead, I am always seeking opportunities to build reliable and efficient systems that excite me and inspire people.
